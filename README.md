hello world guide to github

I am for the most part, a self taught programmer looking to make a mark on the world. I am currently learning Python as my third language. HTML, and CSS were my first languages. 
I want to become a software engineer at google, or launch my own startup creating software that can be useful, and create an impact on society in some way.
i want to learn everything there is to know about software and programming.
